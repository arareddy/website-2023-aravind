I recently joined as a postdoctoral associate at the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/), where my primary mentor is [Dr. Victoria Popic](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/victoria-popic). Prior to joining the Broad, I graduated from [Northwestern](https://www.northwestern.edu/) with a PhD in Computer Science. At NU, I was in the [CS theory group](https://theory.cs.northwestern.edu/) and was very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Konstantin Makarychev](https://konstantin.makarychev.net/) and [Prof. Aravindan Vijayaraghavan](https://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~aravindv/). A long time ago in a galaxy far far away, I spent four wonderful years at [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in/) as a spirited undergrad majoring in Computer Science and Engineering, and minoring in Physics .

My research is broadly in the theoretical foundations of machine learning. More specifically, I have worked on projects related to Causal Inference, Clustering, Determinantal Point Processes, Graphical Models, and Submodular Function Optimization. More recently, I have been interested in Computational Biology, which is the research area I will majorly be working while at the Broad.
