I am a postdoctoral associate at the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/), where my primary mentor is [Dr. Victoria Popic](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/victoria-popic). Prior to joining the Broad, I graduated from [Northwestern](https://www.northwestern.edu/) with a PhD in Computer Science. At NU, I was in the [CS theory group](https://theory.cs.northwestern.edu/) and was very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Konstantin Makarychev](https://konstantin.makarychev.net/) and [Prof. Aravindan Vijayaraghavan](https://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~aravindv/). A long time ago in a galaxy far far away, I spent four wonderful years at [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in/) as a spirited undergrad majoring in Computer Science and Engineering, and minoring in Physics.

My research is broadly in the foundations of Machine Learning and its applications in Computational Biology. More specifically, I have worked on projects related to [Causal Inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_inference), [Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis), [Determinantal Point Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.6083), [Graphical Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model), and [Submodular Function Maximization](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/.cs.cmu.edu/Web/People/dgolovin/papers/submodular_survey12.pdf). Currently, I am working on the applications of machine learning for finding [structural variants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_variation) in DNA sequences.
