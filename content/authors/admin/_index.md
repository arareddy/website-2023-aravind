Hello! I recently returned to India and am now applying for faculty positions in CS and/or AI departments at Indian universities. My academic journey includes a postdoctoral stint at the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/), a six-month experience where I immersed myself in the vast and fascinating domain of Computational Biology. Prior to this, I completed my PhD in Computer Science in June 2023 at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/), located on the scenic shores of Lake Michigan. At Northwestern, I was a part of the nurturing [CS theory group](https://theory.cs.northwestern.edu/) and was very fortunate to have been advised by [Prof. Konstantin Makarychev](https://konstantin.makarychev.net/) and [Prof. Aravindan Vijayaraghavan](https://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~aravindv/). Additionally, my PhD journey was enriched by collaborating with researchers at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com) during summer internships in 2021 and 2022.

A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, I was a spirited undergrad at [IIT Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in/), where I spent four transformative years majoring in Computer Science and Engineering with a minor in Physics. This journey across continents and disciplines has prepared me for a career in academia, where I hope to contribute to the vibrant academic landscape in India.

My research interests span a diverse array of topics within machine learning, including [Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis), [Graphical Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model), [Determinantal Point Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.6083), [Submodular Function Maximization](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/.cs.cmu.edu/Web/People/dgolovin/papers/submodular_survey12.pdf), and [Causal Inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_inference). I view myself as an interdisciplinary researcher, with several of the machine learning models I've worked on being inspired directly by concepts from Statistical Physics. Additionally, I have also dabbled in Computational Biology, particularly in using deep learning to identify [structural variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_variation) in DNA sequences.
