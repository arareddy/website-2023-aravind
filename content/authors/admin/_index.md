Hello! I am a Visiting Assistant Professor at [IIT Hyderabad](https://iith.ac.in/) in the [Department of Artificial Intelligence (AI)](https://ai.iith.ac.in). Prior to this, I was a postdoc at the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/), where I dipped my toes in the vast and fascinating world of Computational Biology. I graduated with my PhD in Computer Science from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/), located on the scenic shores of Lake Michigan. At Northwestern, I was a part of the nurturing [CS theory group](https://theory.cs.northwestern.edu/) and was very fortunate to have been advised by [Prof. Konstantin Makarychev](https://konstantin.makarychev.net/) and [Prof. Aravindan Vijayaraghavan](https://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~aravindv/). Additionally, my PhD journey was enriched by collaborating with researchers at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com).

A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, I was a spirited undergrad at [IIT Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in/), where I spent four transformative years majoring in Computer Science and Engineering with a minor in Physics. My research interests span a diverse array of topics in the intersection of AI and Theoretical Computer Science, including [Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis), [Graphical Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model), [Determinantal Point Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.6083), [Submodular Function Maximization](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/.cs.cmu.edu/Web/People/dgolovin/papers/submodular_survey12.pdf), and [Causal Inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_inference). I view myself as an interdisciplinary researcher, with several of the Machine Learning models I've worked on being directly inspired from Statistical Physics. Additionally, I have also dabbled in Computational Biology, particularly in using Deep Learning to identify [structural variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_variation) in DNA sequences.
