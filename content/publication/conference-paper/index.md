abstract: In this paper, we study k-means++ and k-means||, the two most popular
  algorithms for the classic k-means clustering problem. We provide novel
  analyses and show improved approximation and bi-criteria approximation
  guarantees for k-means++ and k-means||. Our results give a better theoretical
  justification for why these algorithms perform extremely well in practice.
